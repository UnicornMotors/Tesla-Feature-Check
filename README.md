What happens to the data from my old computer?
To maintain all of your settings and preferences, your data will first be securely transferred to your new FSD computer.

You may also conduct a factory reset at any time by tapping ‘Controls’ > ‘Service’ > ‘Factory Reset.’

## Features
Will my car performance or features change after the FSD computer is installed?
After the FSD computer is installed, you will continue to have to your existing features and, when paired with FSD capability, you will also have access to more Full Self-Driving capability features like Traffic and Stop Sign Control (Beta). Learn more about currently enabled Autopilot and Full Self-Driving capabilities.

**What will I get when I purchase the Full Self-Driving capability?**  
You will get access to a suite of more advanced driver assistance features, designed to provide more active guidance and automatic driving under your active supervision. Learn more about the features included like Navigate on Autopilot, Smart Summon, Auto Lane Change and Autopark. The FSD computer upgrade does enable recording from all cameras with Sentry Mode and DashCam for vehicles previously equipped with Autopilot computer 2.0 or 2.5 and paired with the Infotainment Upgrade.

**Will the FSD computer make my car fully autonomous?**  
Not yet. All Tesla cars require active driver supervision and are not autonomous. With the FSD computer, we expect to achieve a new level of autonomy as we gain billions of miles of experience using our features. The activation and use of these features are dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions.
